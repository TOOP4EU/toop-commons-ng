Change from v3 to v4: 
Hi all, as mentioned this morning on our call I had to generated new key and certificates for the CA’s in the TOOP pilot PKI due to loss of the old keys’ passwords :enttäuscht:. In attached ZIP you find the new certificates for the three CAs in the PKI (root, authorities (DC/DP) and AP). These certificates must be *added* to the truststore of the connector and gateways as the old certificate should still be accepted so we don’t need to renew all the already issued certificates. Once again sorry for the inconvenience this causes…
